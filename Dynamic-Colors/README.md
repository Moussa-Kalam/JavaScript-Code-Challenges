Dynamic Colors

## What You'll Do

Create three buttons: blue, pink, and green. When each button is clicked, you should set the background of the document body to the selected color.

## Requirements

- Use closures

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `dynamicColors.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, use the `index.html` file to complete your DOM manipulation.
