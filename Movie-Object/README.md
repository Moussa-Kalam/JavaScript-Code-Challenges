# Movie Object

## What You'll Do

Create a Movie object that takes in five arguments:

- title
- director
- genre
- releaseYear
- rating

Add a function called `getOverview` on the Movie prototype which console
logs the following overview for each film:

"<movie>, a <genre> film directed by <director> was released in <releaseYear>. It received a rating of <rating>."

## Requirements

- Use object prototypes

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `movie.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, you will have an HTML element provided for you in the `index.html` file. Use this node to complete your DOM manipulation.
