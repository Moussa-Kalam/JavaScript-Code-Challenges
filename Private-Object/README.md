# Private Object

## What You'll Do

Create a user object which has three properties:

- username
- password
- age

Username and password must not be accessible when accessed with
alert() or console.log(). Age can be publicly accessed.

## Requirements

- Use JavaScript symbols

## Instructions

Develop your solution in the `privateObject.js` file. If this challenge requires you to interact with the DOM, use the `index.html` file to complete your DOM manipulation.
